There were only two other tables occupied, but it soon got much busier. We ordered a Smokey Mountain cocktail, which contained Kraken rhum.

We then got the Fish Ultra, the Calamari and of course, the Mac N Cheese with brisket. Food came at a great pace, and was plated beautifully. The Fish Ultra looked like a lush jewel, with the richly colored fish set in a soft bed of Pont-Blanc cream and blini. The saltiness of the fish and roe contrasted with the cream, and the blini had a great consistency. The Calamari had been prepared sous-vide for 5h, which explained its wonderful texture. It was tender enought to be cut by forks, yet retained the bounce and mounthfeel of fresh calamari. The flavors were subtle and rich, thanks to the bed of pureed cauliflower and piperade. The smokiness of the coconut was perfect with the soft bell peppers, as well as the cocktail, which was also smoked. The Mac N Cheese came last, after a delightful change of plate (I loved the different colors!). The sauce was quite runny and plain, but transformed when mixed with juices from the brisket and Cherry Bomb chimichurri. The chimichurri had a nice acidity and comfortable heat. A hotter sauce was also offered, made with Habanero and whatnot.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we were greeted by Sylvia Robin, who was so pleasant and fun to chat with.

      "Row(text=\"I had this place bookmarked, it was right near our hotel, and it was open late, so it was the perfect dinner spot for us. My BF and I came in at around 10:45 on a Friday and there were a few groups having drinks. The vibe was kind of a party vibe, so if you're looking for a quiet place to talk to your date, this is probably not it.\\n\\nWe decided to do the tasting menu because we couldn't decide on what we wanted. Everything sounded so good. For $35 pp, the menu includes:\\n\\nTakoyaki (fried octopus balls) - these were alright, but I'm not a huge fan of takoyaki to begin with\\nGyu Carpaccio (seared beef sashimi with ponzu, wasabi mayo) - this was one of my favorites of the night. It was thinly sliced, which enhanced the flavor of the raw beef\\nKinoko Bibimbap (rice, mushroom, and cheese with seaweed) - I really enjoyed this bibimbap, most likely because of the cheese. I wish it was served a bit earlier, and not as the last dish because were pretty full by the time it came out. Still ate everything though\\nGomaae (blanched rapini with sesame sauce) - this was only okay, but I appreciated the fact that they threw in some veggies\\nKaki Mayo (baked oysters with spinach, mushroom, garlic mayo, topped with cheese) - when this came out, the cheese was still bubbling. This was another top contender of the night. Cheesy oysters? What's not to love?\\nSalmon Tataki (seared salmon with ponzu and wasabi mayo) - basically the carpaccio from earlier but in salmon form. This was good too - no complaints\\nEbimayo (fried shrimp with spicy mayo) - this was probably the worst dish. The batter was way too thick, and it was also soggy. You could probably find better shrimp tempura in the freezer section of a Costco\\nGyu Shabu Salad (shabu shabu beef with greens and a black sesame dressing) - good way to balance out the heaviness of the other dishes\\nKaraage (fried chicken with garlic mayo) - not the greatest chicken karaage, but not the worst\\nIce cream (choice of matcha or sesame) - each of us ended up getting a different flavor, so that we could try both\\n\\nWe also added on a special, which was 12 pieces of assorted sashimi for $36. While the fish was good, it was a bit pricey, considering a set menu per person is cheaper than that.\\n\\nFor drinks, I had the yuzu cocktail (whiskey, yuzu, and ginger-ale). I didn't taste any alcohol in here but it tasted so good! It was nice and refreshing. We also did a sake bomb each ($5) which is a whole big spectacle here. Every time someone orders a bomb, the whole staff gathers round and screams sake bomb with you. I appreciated that it wasn't a huge glass of beer like it normally is in the US, because after eating all that food, I don't think a whole beer would have fit in my stomach.\\n\\nI would say the food was 4 stars but the overall experience (including the service) brought it to 5 stars.
